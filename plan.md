To accomplish this task, we'll break it down into several steps. Here's a high-level overview of what we need to do:

 1 Set up a PostgreSQL Docker container
 2 Load CSV data into the PostgreSQL database
 3 Set up an Ontop Virtual Knowledge Graph (VKG) Docker container
 4 Configure Ontop to connect to the PostgreSQL database and expose it as a VKG

Let's go through these steps:

 1 Set up a PostgreSQL Docker container:


 docker run --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres


This command creates a PostgreSQL container named "postgres-db" with the password "mysecretpassword" and maps port 5432 to the host.

 2 Load CSV data into the PostgreSQL database:

First, we need to create a database and the necessary tables. You can use the DDL file you have:


 docker cp DDL/ACME_small.ddl postgres-db:/tmp/ACME_small.ddl
 docker exec -it postgres-db psql -U postgres -f /tmp/ACME_small.ddl


Now, to load the CSV files, you can use the \copy command in PostgreSQL. Here's an example for one table:


 docker exec -it postgres-db psql -U postgres -d your_database_name -c "\copy Agreement FROM '/path/to/Agreement.csv' WITH CSV HEADER"


You'll need to repeat this for each CSV file, adjusting the table name and file path accordingly.

 3 Set up an Ontop Virtual Knowledge Graph (VKG) Docker container:

Ontop provides a Docker image that we can use:


 docker run --name ontop-endpoint -d -p 8080:8080 ontop/ontop-endpoint

 4 Configure Ontop to connect to the PostgreSQL database and expose it as a VKG:

You'll need to create a properties file and a mapping file for Ontop. Here's an example of a properties file:


 jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres-db:5432/your_database_name
 jdbc.user=postgres
 jdbc.password=mysecretpassword
 ontology=file:/opt/ontop/input/insurance.ttl
 mapping=file:/opt/ontop/input/mapping.obda


And you'll need to create a mapping file (mapping.obda) that maps the database schema to your ontology.

Once you have these files, you can mount them to the Ontop container:


 docker run --name ontop-endpoint -d -p 8080:8080 \
   -v /path/to/properties/file:/opt/ontop/input/properties \
   -v /path/to/mapping/file:/opt/ontop/input/mapping.obda \
   -v /path/to/ontology/file:/opt/ontop/input/insurance.ttl \
   --link postgres-db:postgres-db \
   ontop/ontop-endpoint


This setup links the Ontop container with the PostgreSQL container and mounts the necessary configuration files.

After these steps, your Ontop VKG should be accessible at http://localhost:8080/sparql.

Note: You'll need to adjust file paths and database names according to your specific setup. Also, ensure that your Docker network allows the containers to communicate with each
other.
